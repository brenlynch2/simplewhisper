# SimpleWhisper: A Flexible and Basic Implementation of the OpenAI Whisper Model.

<p>SimpleWhisper is a single Python script that aims to transcribe either a single audio file or a batch of audio files in a predefined directory, and output the text, with tags according to the file it originated from, into a .txt file within the current working directory.
</p>
<p>SimpleWhisper has several dependencies, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OpenAI's 'Whisper' library</li>
  <li>FFMPEG, a library intended to provide functions for working with different audio files</li>
  <li>PyTorch</li>
  <li>Python's default system libraries</li>
  <li>All of the dependencies not listed here that underpin the aformentioned dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>This script was created and tested on a RHEL 9 (RedHat Enterprise Linux 9) based system, running on a Dell XPS laptop with an Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, and an Nvidia 3050TI with 4GB GDDR5 memory. See the attached video link, contained within the video.txt file in this repository, for an in-depth explanation of how this script was created, how it can be modified to support different operating environments and precision levels, and a demonstration of its functions.</p>
